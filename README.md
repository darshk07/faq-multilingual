# FAQ Management

## Features
#### Multiple language support
#### Automatic caching to reduce overload
#### Translation is done to multiple languages once FAQ is created. Background/CRON worker support in future.

## Steps to run

1. Run the docker-compose file to ensure Postgres and Redis services are up.
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to migrate the schema to your database.
3. Run the http service and frontend service using dev script.
